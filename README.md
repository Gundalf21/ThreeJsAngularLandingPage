# Information About the Project

This project was made mostly as a way to test my (then) newly aquired ThreeJS skills in order to experiment and make a background visual.
Choosing Angular for a project to the likes of a portfolio page was not the brightest idea, and it also meant working differently with Three,
but it was also meant as a way to practice working with Angular and learn the process of development in a more practical way.
This is also the prototype for my website: https://rakundalf.com which was made only using HTML/CSS and JavaScript with ThreeJS, 
which I plan to extend its scope more in the future for the sake of diversifying it visually and also for showcasing more of my projects.

//To run the project use the CLI command: 
npm i
//Then just run like any other Angular CLI project:
ng serve
